About R script

In accordance with the specified task for the course work, the file with the R code "run analysis.R" executes the five stages below:
To read the files and in order to combine the test and training sets to produce a single data set.
Read files in order to examine  training and test tables.
The reading a feature vector and  Study instruction labels along with assigning the names of the  variables. Then merge all data into a single set. Removing all but the average and standard deviation for each measurement
Read the names of variables to create a vector in which the ID, mean, and standard deviation are defined. Create necessary subsets from the combined data set. 
Activities in the data collection are named with evocative activity names.
Label  the data set appropriately with variable names assembling a second, separate tidy dta which contains the avaerage of each variable (activity and subject)
Creating a text file with a second tidy data set.The code takes for granted that all the data is in the same location, uncompressed, and that the names haven't been changed.
Regarding variables:
The data from files contained in the variables x train, y train, x test, y test, subject train, and subject test.
The prior datasets are combined into x data, y data, and subject data for additional analysis.
